<h1>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h1>
<p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
  The main thing to remember when using classes versus ids in HTML/CSS is **classes** can be used as many times as needed within a document.  **IDs** can only be applied once within a document.  Just like no two people should have the same passport number, NEVER use the same id on different elements.

You can also combine classes within an element, such as:
<br>
<code>
<p class="highlight indent">

.highlight { font-weight: bold; }
.indent { padding-left: 2em; }
</code>

<br>

<p>Lastly, ids have higher specificity than classes.  When declaration conflicts arise, these conflicts are resolved using the cascade rules - In simple terms, if a class selector and ID selector were to be in conflict, the ID selector wins.

Classes should be used mostly to group elements that have something in common together into a class, in order to be able to address them later. Classes are mostly used for styling. </p>
