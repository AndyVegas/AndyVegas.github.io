        <h2>Every class is an instance of a class called Class! -  A Classy Technical Blog</h2>
        
<p>As I’ve been learning Ruby, I’ve been working with various types — numbers, strings, arrays, and hashes. Ruby calls these things classes. 
</p>

<p>As we're going along creating a program, it can be cumbersome to remember each small nuanced part of what we're working with and remember those parts in terms that computers understand.  We start to abstract that away using representations of things we're used to in the real world.  These representations are called classes.</p>

<p>
A class is best described as a blueprint - the blueprint tells Ruby how a class should be structured and what it should do.  For example, a blueprint of a car would show how a car can be made, however it would not go into details about an individual car, like the color.   </p>

<p>In Ruby, a class definition is a region of code between the keywords "class" and "end". A def inside this region begins the definition of a method of the class, which corresponds to some specific behavior for objects of that class.</p>

<p>It’s pretty simple to create a class, and since Ruby is cool, we can make them like real-world objects.  Here I've created a pretty useless Name class.</p>

<p>The class name should be capitalized, as in the example below:</p>
<pre><code>

class Name

  def title
    "Mr."
  end

  def first_name
    "Worthington"
  end

  def middle_name
    "Zhang"
  end

  def last_name
    "Shufflebottom"
  end

end

</code></pre>

</div><!--/.primary-->

<div class="secondary col">

<p>
By defining basic classes, we can use some of Ruby’s nice little features to make setting up the boilerplate code much easier.  A Class method is a piece of functionality that belongs to that class, but is not tied to any particular single instance.  Instance Methods on the other hand, can only be called on a particular instance of the class.</p>

<pre><code>
class Walmart
  def self.find(id)
    puts "#{id}"
  end
 
  def products
    []
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, "products" is an Instance method.  You use Instance Methods when you need to act on a particular instance of the class.
