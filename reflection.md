## What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that CSS padding properties are used to generate space around content.  The padding properties set the size of the white space between the element content and the element border.  CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border, and margin properties are used to generate space around elements.  The margin properties set the size of the white space outside the border.


## What did you learn about CSS positioning?
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed or absolute).  Static is the default and a static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.  Relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties (top, right, bottom and left).  A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. As with relative, the top, right, bottom, and left properties are used.  Absolute is the most difficult to wrap my head around, as absolute behaves like fixed except relative to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport.


## What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Adding color I found easy because it is very straightforward in CSS.  Positioning and centering elements gave me some trouble.  


## What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
A whole lot!  I managed to achieve most of what I laid out in my wireframe, but the look is still nowhere near where i want it.
