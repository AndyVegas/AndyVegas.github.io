  REFLECTION:
  How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  - It was interesting.  My partner definitely had skills I lacked and vice versa which made for an efficient duo.  We used google hangout to communicate more directly.  
  Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  - Yes.  Wireframing seems like a must before a design project of any description.  The layout I had originally quickly evolved thanks to wireframing.  
  What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  - We checked out some cool looking websites and blogs and took our favorite bits to create a custom wireframe.  
  What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  - A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.  Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.  Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <img> - Clearly defines its content.  I used <section> and <article> for this blog page.
