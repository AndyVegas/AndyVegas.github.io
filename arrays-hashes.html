        <h2>Arrays and Hashes - Technical Blog</h2>

Ruby looks at collections of objects by putting them inside container objects.  In Ruby, there are two main built-in classes we will be dealing with: arrays and hashes.  
</p>
<p>
Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object.  Ruby array indexing starts at 0.  A negative index is assumed to be relative to the end of the array; that is, an index of -1 indicates the last element of the array, -2 is the next to last element in the array, and so on.  Arrays can contain different types of object - integers, strings, floats, etc.  An array’s job is simply to store other objects.   </p>

<p>
Hashes are also ordered collections.  Hashes store objects in pairs, each pair consisting of a key and a value.  You retrieve a value by using the key.  They are similar to arrays, but where an array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type.  Keys are unique per hash: you can only have one key/value pair for any given key.  </p>

<p>
Arrays and hashes are closely connected.  An array is, in a sense, a has where the keys happen to be consecutive integers.  </p>

<p>
<u>Here are some examples of arrays:</u>
<code>
<p>array = [“platinum”, “gold”, “silver”]</p>
<p>second_array = [1, "two", 3.0]</p>
<p>i_wanna_visit = [“Maldives”, “Africa”, “New Zealand”, “Thailand”]</p>
</code>
<p>In the case of the bottom array, “puts i_wanna_visit[1]"" would print “Africa” to the screen.</p>
<p>
<u>And here are some examples of hashes:</u>
</p>
<code>
<p>fave_cologne = Hash.new
{"Paul" => "Acqua di Gio", "Johnny" => "Polo Sport", "Randy" => "Brut"}</p>
<p>hash = {“best“ => “platinum”, “better” => “gold”, “good” => “silver”}</p>
<p>grades = { "Johnny" => 90, "Billy" => 88, "Jenny" => 94 }</p>
</code>
<p>To output the entire last hash, you would type "puts grades" or you could output a key by calling its value. graders["Billy"] would output "88."</p>
